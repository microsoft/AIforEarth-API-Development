# Animal Detection (camera trap) Example
This example shows you how to deploy an animal detection model via an AI for Earth container. This example integrates the [AI for Earth camera trap repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps).

## Download the model
Before you can build the API, the model must be downloaded. You can follow the instructions from the [AI for Earth camera trap repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/README.md) to download and learn about the animal detection model.
